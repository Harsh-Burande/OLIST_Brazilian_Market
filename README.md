Olist Delivery Performance Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes delivery performance in the Olist e-commerce dataset to understand how delivery timelines impact customer satisfaction and identify high-impact areas for operational improvement.

Objective
- Evaluate delivery efficiency and delays
- Assess the impact of delivery time on customer reviews
- Identify high-risk delivery segments for targeted improvements

Approach
- Cleaned and standardized order and delivery timestamps
- Engineered delivery metrics (delivery time, delays, on-time flag)
- Categorized customer reviews into experience buckets
- Analyzed delivery performance across customers, categories, and regions

Key Insights
- Customer satisfaction decreases as delivery time increases
- Poor reviews are associated with significantly longer delivery durations
- Repeat customers receive slightly faster deliveries than first-time customers
- ~13.5% of orders fall into a high-risk long-delivery segment, representing a focused opportunity for improvement

Tools-
Python (pandas, numpy), Plotly, Google Colab, Power BI

Conclusion-
Targeting the worst delivery experiences—rather than overhauling the entire logistics system—can deliver disproportionate gains in customer satisfaction with minimal operational effort.
